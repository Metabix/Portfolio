                                        Developed a system that predicts traffic using a combination of a microcontroller, pre-polarized microphone, LTE connectivity, and a machine learning model.
                                         The microphone captures audio data from the environment, such as vehicle noises and traffic flow sounds. 
                                         This data is processed by the microcontroller to extract key features, which are then transmitted via LTE to a server(MQTT). 
                                         Used machine learning model to analyzes the data to predict traffic conditions in real time. 
                                         This system enables accurate, location-independent traffic monitoring, making it ideal for smart city applications.

                        <div>
                            As we know GPS has limitation of providing accurate positioning for indoor architecture. Due to this limitation, Researchers have been trying to
                            find alternative methods for localisation. Currently Researchers have focused on using Radio waves, Bluetooth signals, Etc for localization, but
                            They are prone to multi-path propagation.
                            Prof. Herald Haas recently started using Light to transmit data, which is known as LiFi and this is an application of Vissible Light Communication.
                            Like VLC, VLP is similar, the research work at ford was based on VLP using IR light. I studied and built a prototype for this application and submitted
                            the final limitation of the system.
                            I also provided an alternation low cost solution using April tags for the project. The system principle remains same in reference of OCC but system
                            hardware is cheaper here. I submitted my proof of work and a working demo of the system which provides a maximum of 6cm error. The system uses
                            garage dimension as parameters and does not require an ML model for localization, which increases portability.

                                    Re-engineered a Medical Unit.
                                    MedSmart is a covid application that was built by Wipro amid covid-19. 
                                    The Device had an AI service by a third-party company. My goal in this project was 
                                    to provide the same features without using the service. In short, re-develop the whole project. 
                                    The IoT application uses the MQTT protocol to communicate with ESP, RPI, and the Router. 
                                    Uses a SQL database; where the data is stored in the IoT device for its privacy concern.

                                    Using raspberry pi, I developed a communication layer between PLC CJ2M-CPU33, Fanuc controller - R-30 ib, and AC controller.

                        <p></p><strong>Indoor asset tracking using BLE based real time location system</strong>
                        <div>
                            Most of the asset tracking systems are non real time. Real time asset tracking system 
                            becomes necessary when an asset is of high value and critical to be located in time.
                            Examples of such high value assets could be manufacturing parts lying in various locations on shop floor,  
                            critical medical equipments lying in various locations in hospitals etc.
                            This system would enable users to locate critical assets in real time with an accuracy of about 3 feet 
                            without having to spend time searching for the same.
                            The BLE based real time location system consists of BLE receivers, BLE asset tags , a location engine server
                            and UI server. The BLE beacon receivers are placed at known locations. BLE tag which is connected to the asset 
                            emits wireless BLE beacons periodically. The BLE receivers within range receive the BLE beacons and relay 
                            the BLE beacon message and its RF signal strength
                            to the location engine server. The location engine server determines the absolute location of the asset using 
                            trilateration. The UI server uses this information to provide a visual representation
                            of the asset location on a UI client which shows the asset location as a pin superimposed on an indoor static map
