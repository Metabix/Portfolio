                                    An Internet-of- Things (IoT) can be an effective solution to de-escalate the spread of a pandemic/epidemic using open source 
                                    technology - Bluetooth Low level Energy. The major objective of this contribution is to monitor real time cases and prevent the 
                                    contagious spread of this viral disease. The entire paper focuses on cross checking the data fed by the user with the IoT database 
                                    which consists of the data from the COVID RADAR application. The experimental model uses MCU and a Bluetooth module, which are easy 
                                    to realize and cost effective as well. The realization and prediction of the pandemic hotspots is also facilitated using this data.

                        <div>
                            As we know GPS has limitation of providing accurate positioning for indoor architecture. Due to this limitation, Researchers have been trying to
                            find alternative methods for localisation. Currently Researchers have focused on using Radio waves, Bluetooth signals, Etc for localization, but
                            They are prone to multi-path propagation.
                            Prof. Herald Haas recently started using Light to transmit data, which is known as LiFi and this is an application of Vissible Light Communication.
                            Like VLC, VLP is similar, the research work at ford was based on VLP using IR light. I studied and built a prototype for this application and submitted
                            the final limitation of the system.
                            I also provided an alternation low cost solution using April tags for the project. The system principle remains same in reference of OCC but system
                            hardware is cheaper here. I submitted my proof of work and a working demo of the system which provides a maximum of 6cm error. The system uses
                            garage dimension as parameters and does not require an ML model for localization, which increases portability.

                                    MedSmart is a covid application that was built by Wipro amid covid-19. 
                                    The Device had an AI service by a third-party company. My goal in this project was 
                                    to provide the same features without using the service. In short, re-develop the whole project. 
                                    The IoT application uses the MQTT protocol to communicate with ESP, RPI, and the Router. 
                                    Uses a SQL database; where the data is stored in the IoT device for its privacy concern.

                                    Using raspberry pi, I developed a communication layer between PLC CJ2M-CPU33, Fanuc controller - R-30 ib, and AC controller.

                        <p></p><strong>Indoor asset tracking using BLE based real time location system</strong>
                        <div>
                            Most of the asset tracking systems are non real time. Real time asset tracking system 
                            becomes necessary when an asset is of high value and critical to be located in time.
                            Examples of such high value assets could be manufacturing parts lying in various locations on shop floor,  
                            critical medical equipments lying in various locations in hospitals etc.
                            This system would enable users to locate critical assets in real time with an accuracy of about 3 feet 
                            without having to spend time searching for the same.
                            The BLE based real time location system consists of BLE receivers, BLE asset tags , a location engine server
                            and UI server. The BLE beacon receivers are placed at known locations. BLE tag which is connected to the asset 
                            emits wireless BLE beacons periodically. The BLE receivers within range receive the BLE beacons and relay 
                            the BLE beacon message and its RF signal strength
                            to the location engine server. The location engine server determines the absolute location of the asset using 
                            trilateration. The UI server uses this information to provide a visual representation
                            of the asset location on a UI client which shows the asset location as a pin superimposed on an indoor static map

                    <p>With Blockchain technology poised to	be bigger than the Internet, this course will cover	fundamental	concepts and topics	
                        including, but not limited	to,	Blockchain	security, smart	contracts, non-fungible	tokens (NFTs), Bitcoin mining,	
                        consensus protocols, etc. as it pertains to Internet of Things (IoT) edge device architectures. Students will gain
                        fundamental	knowledge of edge device design	constraints, and may attend	a virtual conference in	embedded system	
                        design (ESWEEK). Due to	the	rapidly	advancing Blockchain field,	this course	is taught seminar style, with an	
                        emphasis on	student-delivered presentations	and an	open discussion	forum. By the end of the course, the students	
                        will write a short research	paper on their topic of	choice. Special	guests	will be	invited	to discuss their research	
                        contributions.	</p>

                            hands-on labs. We will be providing a PCB with an ESP32 and a few simple peripherals which we use in said labs. 
                            We will be exploring issues related to the malicious access of physical ports (UART/JTAG), recovery and editing of 
                            firmware, and some network level security such as Man-in-the-Middle attacks using mitmproxy, as well as 
                            standard methods to mitigate these threats.</p>
