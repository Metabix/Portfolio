                                    Re-engineered a Medical Unit.
                                    MedSmart is a covid application that was built by Wipro amid covid-19. 
                                    The Device had an AI service by a third-party company. My goal in this project was 
                                    to provide the same features without using the service. In short, re-develop the whole project. 
                                    The IoT application uses the MQTT protocol to communicate with ESP, RPI, and the Router. 
                                    Uses a SQL database; where the data is stored in the IoT device for its privacy concern.

                                    The objective of this project was to implement an IoT feature for Spot Welding Device.
                                    Using raspberry pi, I developed a communication layer between PLC CJ2M-CPU33, Fanuc controller - R-30 ib, and AC controller.

                        <p></p><strong>Indoor asset tracking using BLE based real time location system</strong>
                        <div>
                            Most of the asset tracking systems are non real time. Real time asset tracking system 
                            becomes necessary when an asset is of high value and critical to be located in time.
                            Examples of such high value assets could be manufacturing parts lying in various locations on shop floor,  
                            critical medical equipments lying in various locations in hospitals etc.
                            This system would enable users to locate critical assets in real time with an accuracy of about 3 feet 
                            without having to spend time searching for the same.
                            The BLE based real time location system consists of BLE receivers, BLE asset tags , a location engine server
                            and UI server. The BLE beacon receivers are placed at known locations. BLE tag which is connected to the asset 
                            emits wireless BLE beacons periodically. The BLE receivers within range receive the BLE beacons and relay 
                            the BLE beacon message and its RF signal strength
                            to the location engine server. The location engine server determines the absolute location of the asset using 
                            trilateration. The UI server uses this information to provide a visual representation
                            of the asset location on a UI client which shows the asset location as a pin superimposed on an indoor static map

                        We will be exploring issues related to the malicious access of physical ports (UART/JTAG), recovery and editing of 
                        firmware, and some network level security such as Man-in-the-Middle attacks using mitmproxy, as well as

                                signals,	and	2)	how	to	deliver	image/video	signals	over	networks. Topics	to	be	covered	
                                include:	image	acquisition	and	display	using	digital	devices,	properties	of	human	visual	
                                perception,	sampling	and	quantization,	image	enhancement,	image	restoration,	twodimensional	Fourier	transforms,	linear	and	nonlinear	filtering,	morphological	operations,	
                                noise	removal,	image	deblurring,	edge	detection,	image	registration	and	geometric
